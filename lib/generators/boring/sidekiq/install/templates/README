===============================================================================

We've protected Sidekiq routes with Devise to ensure only authenticated users can access them.
This is implemented in the following snippet located in the config/routes.rb file.
```
authenticate :user do
  mount Sidekiq::Web => '/sidekiq'
end
```
Please adjust it as necessary to suit your requirements.
